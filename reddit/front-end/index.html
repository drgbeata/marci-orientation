        I apologize, Mr. Freeman, but I couldn't risk opening that door until I
        was sure you'd scoured the area. This is the last entrance to the Lambda
        Complexâ€”every other has been sealed off to contain the invasion. When we
        realized that you might actually make it here, we drew straws to see who
        should stay behind to let you through. Obviously, I drew the short one.
        My colleagues are waiting at the tip of the Lambda reactor...waiting for
        you, I mean. The reactor is shut down right now, but you can activate it
        on your way up. You'll have to flood the core anyway to get into the
        teleportation labs. You're not authorized to know about those...but I
        can see you already know a great deal more than any one man is supposed
        to.
